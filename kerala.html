        <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">CULTURE OF KERALA</h1>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">Kerala's culture is a beautiful amalgamation of traditional art forms, literature, and music. The state is renowned for its classical dance forms, especially Kathakali, a dramatic dance that tells stories through elaborate costumes and facial expressions, and Mohiniyattam, a graceful dance style performed by women. Theyam is another mesmerizing ritualistic dance that combines dance, music, and symbolism, performed mainly in temples. The arts are deeply rooted in Kerala's spiritual and social fabric, often seen in religious festivals and temple celebrations. Kerala also has a rich history of literature and philosophy, with great poets and thinkers contributing to Malayalam literature and cultural discourse.</p>

        <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">FESTIVALS OF KERALA</h1>
        <p class="font-weight-bold"> Kerala’s festivals are vibrant, colorful, and filled with communal spirit. 
            The most important festival is Onam, a harvest celebration that marks the homecoming of the mythical King Mahabali. 
            Onam is celebrated with elaborate Sadya feasts, traditional boat races, flower decorations (Pookalam), 
            and a variety of folk performances like Pulikali (tiger dance) and Thiruvathira. 
            Vishu marks the start of the Malayalam New Year, and Attukal Pongala is a unique festival where women gather to cook
             offerings 
            in large pots. 
            Thrissur Pooram, one of the grandest temple festivals in Kerala, features
             a spectacular display of elephants, fireworks, and traditional music, drawing visitors from all over the world.</p>

        <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">FOOD OF KERALA</h1>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">Kerala's cuisine is as diverse and rich as its culture. The food is heavily influenced by the state's geography, with its coastal region offering an abundance of seafood, while the inland areas provide rice, vegetables, and spices. The Sadya is perhaps the most iconic Kerala dish, served on a banana leaf during festivals, and it includes a variety of rice, curries, pickles, and desserts like Payasam. Kerala’s seafood dishes are legendary, with favorites like Fish Moilee, a creamy fish curry, Karimeen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish wrapped in banana leaves), and spicy prawn curry. Appam, a rice pancake, and Puttu, a steamed rice cake, are common breakfast items. Kerala’s unique blend of coconut, curry leaves, and fresh spices gives its cuisine a distinctive flavor.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold"> Kerala is known for its stunning natural beauty, and there are many tourist spots that highlight the state's diverse landscapes. The Backwaters of Kerala are a popular attraction, especially in places like Alleppey and Kumarakom, where tourists can enjoy serene boat rides through lush green canals surrounded by coconut trees. The hill stations of Munnar, with its sprawling tea gardens and mist-covered hills, offer a cool retreat from the heat. Kerala’s beaches, including Varkala, Kovalam, and Bekal, are famous for their scenic beauty and calm waters. The Athirappilly Waterfalls, often called the "Niagara of India," and the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, home to elephants and tigers, are must-visit spots for nature lovers. For those seeking a spiritual experience, the ancient temples of Sabarimala and Padmanabhaswamy offer a glimpse into Kerala’s rich religious heritage.</p>
